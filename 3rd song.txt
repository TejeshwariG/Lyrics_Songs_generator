"Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome, Beyoncé, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly and Ashley
The hip hop rappin' Girls' TYME"
I'm out that H, town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, Town, Town, I'm coming down, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow bow down, bitches (crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow bow down, bitches (crown)
H Town, vicious
H, H Town, vicious
I'm so crown crown, bow down, bitches
I'm about that H, town,…
