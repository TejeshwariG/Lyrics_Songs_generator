Ooh, ooh
Across the ocean, across the sea
Startin' to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face
I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road and upside down now
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Through the sorrow
And the fights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
Anf for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I
Oh I
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-a'ightâ€¦
